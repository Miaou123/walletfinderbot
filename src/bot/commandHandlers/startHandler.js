Welcome to Noesis! üëÅÔ∏è

For more information on the bot and the current beta phase, please check our <a href="https://smp-team.gitbook.io/noesis-bot">documentation</a> and follow us on <a href="https://x.com/NoesisTracker">twitter</a>.

If you are already whitelisted you can start by using /help for a full list of commands.

If you are not whitelisted yet:

‚Ä¢ DM @NoesisTracker on twitter or @rengon0x on Twitter/Telegram to request access.
‚Ä¢ Available Spots: ${availableSpots}/${maxUsers}
‚Ä¢ Selection Process: Access is granted on a first-come, first-served basis. Inactive users will be removed on a daily basis, and the total number of spots will be increased every week.

üì¢ Noesis is now available for groups! You can add the bot to your groupchat and use the /scan and /bundle commands without having to be whitelisted. 

If you have any questions, want to report a bug or have any new feature suggestions feel free to dm @Rengon0x on telegram or twitter!

Please note that some commands may take longer to execute than expected. This is primarily due to API restrictions, as we're currently using lower-tier API access. 
As we advance, we intend to upgrade to higher tiers, which will result in 4‚Äì10x faster response times.

‚ö†Ô∏èThis bot is still in development phase and will probably be subject to many bugs/issues‚ö†Ô∏è
